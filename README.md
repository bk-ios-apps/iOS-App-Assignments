Smoothie List App
Goal of the App:
The Smoothie List is an iOS app that utilizes Parse.com as a Backend as a Service (BaaS). This app allows users to save 
a smoothie’s name, ingredients, the time needed to make it, and estimated cost of ingredients on the Parse’s database. 
When a user launches the app, he or she will be able to see the list of smoothies that are already in the database. 
A user can select and tap on the name to view details about that particular smoothie. The user can also tap on the “+” 
navigation button to add a new smoothie and save it on the database. Figure 1, shows the table view screen with a list 
of smoothies.
